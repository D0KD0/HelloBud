                        <h3> What is Cannabis</h3>
                        <p>
                            CBD is short for cannabidiol, a chemical compound found in cannabis. That's it! Though we do have a special name for
                            the type of chemical compound it is. That's “cannabinoid.”
                        </p>
                        <h4> Cannabid who?</h4>
                            <p> Cannabinoids are chemical compounds found in both cannabis and the human body. Let that sink in. You can find
                            cannabinoids in weed and your own body.

                        <h3> The History of Hash</h3>
                      <p>
                            Hashish, or hash, is a concentrate produced by pressing or rubbing together the resin glands of a cannabis plant to form brick, slab, or rolled pieces. Though hash is popular today, it has a long and fascinating history, if you like legends of assassins, sheiks, and generals from Persia, Egypt, and other exotic locales. Read on to learn more about the history of hash, the original weed concentrate.

                    <h5> Early beginnings of hash use</h5>

                    <p>The history of using cannabis for its anesthetic qualities can be traced as far back as the Neolithic period, approximately 4000 BCE. Hash consumption began a little later in Persia (primarily Iran) and Central Asia (primarily Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan). It's likely that hash, like cannabis, traveled the Silk Road out of eastern Asia to the Middle East. Early on it was more likely used as incense than for anything else. Incense, like that produced using frankincense and myrrh, was quite valuable in ancient times. These substances were also resins that had been used as medicine and in religious ceremonies for centuries. </p>

                    <p>Charas, or resin produced by gently rubbing growing cannabis plants, was the earliest form of hash. But when agriculture came into being, around 9000 BCE in India, woven sieves were developed to separate grains from plants. Those same sieves were used to separate cannabis resin from the rest of the harvested, dried plant, creating the first hash, according to preeminent hash scholar Frenchy Cannolli. Charas is still made, mostly in India, by hand rubbing live plants. Hash is differentiated by the fact that it's sieved, by hand or mechanically, from dried, cured cannabis.</p>

                    <h5> Hash in modern times</h5>

                    <p>Hash consumption continued to expand and the primary method of consumption switched from eating to smoking with the arrival of tobacco in the 1500s. During the 18th and 19th centuries, changes to production methods helped increase output and distribution as demand for hash grew.</p>

                    <p>In 1798, during the French occupation of Egypt, Brigadier General Napoléon Bonaparte outlawed cannabis and hash consumption and ordered the public burning of hash coming into the country. He believed that hash and cannabis use resulted in mental disturbance, overindulgent behavior, and interfered with rational thought. Despite Bonaparte's attempts, his own French troops from the Armée d'Orient as well as a group of scientists, engineers, and artists from the Commission des Sciences et des Arts took hash back to France after serving in Egypt.

                    <p>Le Club des Hashischins — also spelled “Club des Hashishins” or “Club des Hachichins,” which translates as the Club of Hashish-Eaters — formed in Paris in 1843. The group held monthly meetings at the Hôtel Pimodan, which is the modern-day Hôtel de Lauzun, to experiment with and explore the effects of hash, as there was an interest among the club's members about the possibility that it could heighten their artistry and ingenuity. A number of the participants were part of the Parisian intelligentsia, including famed writers (Alexandre Dumas, Théophile Gautier, Victor Hugo, Honoré de Balzac), painters (Eugène Delacroix), and other members of Paris' intellectual elite.</p>

                    <p>Dr. Jacques-Joseph Moreau, a psychiatric physician, was another notable member of the club who wrote the first publication by a medical doctor about the effects of a drug on the human nervous system. Moreau wanted to learn about treating mental illnesses; he gained a lot of firsthand knowledge about hash from self-experimentation. His book, titled Du Hachisch et de L'aliénation Mentale — Études Psychologiques (Hashish and Mental Illness — Psychological Studies), was published in 1845 and received an honorable mention distinction from the French Academy of Sciences in 1946. The recognition of Dr. Moreau's work helped substantiate and legitimize hash, supporting its possibilities as a medical treatment in the scientific community.</p>

                    <p>Beginning in the mid-1950s, hippies from Western countries began traveling from the UK, France, Germany, and Italy through Central Asia to India and Thailand on what was called the Hippie Trail or the Overland. A big draw was the easy, inexpensive, legal drugs to be found along the way, including cannabis and hash. In the '60s, Morocco's hash production really took off, in part because of the Hippie Trail.</p> 

                    <p>Hash history is a bit difficult to pin down with certainty. Some sources say the oldest continuous culture of hash production can be found in Afghanistan, the biggest producer of top-notch hashish today. But hash-making still happens in India, Nepal, and other areas where it was born. Morocco and Spain definitely contribute but so do California and other parts of the US. As cannabis legalization has spread, so has cultivation and interest in resin production, including the ancient form popular with Mongols, Persians, and hippies alike, hashish. </p>

        <p>To smoke or not to smoke? If you want to reap the potential therapeutic benefits of cannabis while protecting your health, you've probably pondered the safety of smoking. Although a joint has long been the quickest and most convenient method of ingesting cannabis, mounting evidence suggests that regularly smoking weed is linked to many undesirable effects on the respiratory system.</p>
        <p>When it comes to health, knowledge is power. Becoming informed about the pros and cons of smoking cannabis empowers you to determine whether smoking is the right choice for your body or not. </p>

        <p>The benefits of smoking as a delivery method
        In a 2016-2017 JAMA survey of 169,036 patients who used cannabis for medical conditions, 77.5% reported that they favored smoking as their preferred delivery method. In a 2019 survey published in Gerontology and Geriatric Medicine, both medical and recreational users identified smoking as their favorite way of ingesting the plant.</p>

        <p>Cannabis vaporization has exploded in popularity in recent years. Vaporization, or vaping, uses vapor to disseminate cannabinoids into the bloodstream. There is a wide range of vaping devices available to meet the needs of different users, and it's recognized as an easy and discreet method of consuming cannabis.</p>

        <p><p>Although vaping cannabis only became common in the past several years, the practice has been around for much longer. The first electronic cigarette patent was filed in 1963. The invention wasn't mass-produced, but four decades later, pharmacist Hon Lik patented the vape pen and vaping took off. By 2014, global sales of vaping devices were worth just under $5 billion. In 2018 the global market had doubled to $11.5 billion, according to a forecast by market research company iMarc.</p>

    <p>A 2019 outbreak of lung disease linked to vaping has recently thrown the belief that vaping is a safe alternative to smoking into question. Research into vaping is helping us to understand what contributed to this crisis, and whether vaping still represents a safe method of cannabis consumption or not.</p>

        <p>There are a few criteria you'll want to consider when choosing a strain:</p>

<li>Flavor and aroma. A strain's terpene profile can produce subtle or intense flavors and aromas. Depending on your personal preferences, you can choose a strain that provides that flavor and aroma at the intensity that seems appealing to you.</li>
<li>Desired effects. Everyone reacts to cannabis differently, and there's no guarantee that a strain will produce any particular effect. You can, however, try strains with a cannabinoid and terpene profile that are likely to produce your desired effect. For example, if you want to experience intoxicating effects, it would make sense to go with something with a higher THC content. If you were looking for a more relaxing experience, you might try a strain containing linalool, a terpene reported to have stress-relieving properties.</li>
<li>Potency. Depending on the concentration of cannabinoids, particularly THC, some strains are more potent than others and the level of potency you're looking for can help you decide which strains to try. Looking for an intense high? Try something more potent. Looking for a less intense experience? Go with something less potent.</li>
<li>Growing method. Some people have a preference for weed that is grown in or outdoors. If you're one of those people, you'll obviously want to try strains that align with your personal preference.</li>
<li>Potential medical benefits. Depending on a strain's cannabinoid ratio or terpene profile, it could have a variety of possible medicinal properties. If you're thinking about using cannabis to treat a medical condition, talk to a medical professional to find out which strains might be helpful.</li>
<li>Budget. There are strains at every price point, from wallet-friendly to high-end. If you have a particular budget in mind, that can definitely play into which cannabis strains you decide to try. </li>
